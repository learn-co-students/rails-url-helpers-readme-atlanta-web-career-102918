# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  # postone = Post.create([{ title: 'Oil Change' }, { description: 'Its real easy to do' }])

  postwo = Post.create([{ title: 'Polish Shoes' }, { description: 'Five minutes and some spit.' }])

  postthree = Post.create([{ title: 'Gum' }, { description: 'Chew it up' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
